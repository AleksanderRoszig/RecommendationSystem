# RecommendationSystem
I want to build recommendation system that is focused on Content-based Filtering.
Using coisne similarity is the most popular method to rate articles compared to user interest.
When user declares what he likes in rating from 1 to 10 the algorithm calculate coisne similarity to all products, sort them
and show ten products which can be the most appealing to the user.
This method is used among others in Amazon. This program is based on simple inputs but it can also be 
developed to big application on Content-based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering. Methods of building advanced system
of recommendation are based on assumption that exist in my application.
